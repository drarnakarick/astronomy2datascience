      <h2>Visualising the career paths of astronomers who moved from academia to data science</h2>
    </div>

     <div class="content">

  <p>The <a href="http://www.s2ds.org/"><font style="color:#b2ea86">Science to Data Science (S2DS)</font></a> and <a href="https://www.insightdatascience.com/"><font style="color:#fff689">Insight Data Science</font></a> fellowships are 5â€“7 week intensive post-doctoral training fellowships that bridge the gap between academia and data science in industry. </p>

    The visualisation was created to get a better sense of when astronomers move into data science and how they make that transition. How many postdocs do mid- career astronomers have on their CV before they move into data science? Are tenured astronomers moving into data scinece? How many go through a data science fellowship programs? At what stage of their career do they do this? How many make the transition without a data science fellowship? Have any moved back and forth between academia and data science? </p>

  <p><strong>The data: </strong> comes from the LinkedIn profiles of 116 astronomers who moved from astronomy to data science at some point in their career.</p>

      <p>15% of astronomers moved into data science without going through the S2DS or Insight Fellowship programs. Of those, half had at least one postdoc position and half moved into data science roles straight after their PhD. </p>
